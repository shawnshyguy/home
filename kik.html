</head><h1>Welcome to SSG for Kik!</h1>
<p>SSG for Kik is a test of the Kik.js script provided by the awesome ppl that work on Kik, and have kept it alive for a comparitavely long time. Note that if you're not using the kik browser, you can't access these <i>dank</i> features.<br>On kik, simply tap on the browser button and type the url <b>http://bit.ly/2ad69CG</b><br>Also! Keep an eye out for the doom guy bot. he doesn't do much right now, but add @doomguybot on kik to stay updated.</p>
<script src="http://cdn.kik.com/kik/2.3.6/kik.js">
if (kik.enabled) {
    <p>Congrats! You're in the Kik Browser, and ready to futz with all the - albeit pointless - features.</p>
}
kik.send({
    title     : 'Hello Human!'         ,
    text      : 'This is a test message from the ShawnShyGuy team. And by that, I mean me, no one else helped with this one. I did it at 4AM and all my code friends are sleeping rn'          
});
<p>about doom guy...</p>
kik.openConversation('doomguybot');
