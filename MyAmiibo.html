<p><b>What is MyAmiibo?</b><br>MyAmiibo is a up-and-coming thing that allows you to show off your amiibo in your forum signature or whereever you desire.<br>If you're interested in updates on when this thing goes live, agree to the box below. It'll set you up with a notification from your browser when the project becomes active. Note that you need a browser like Chrome or Firefox that supports the notification API as documented <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification">here.</a></p>
<button onclick="notifyMe()">Notify me!</button>
<js>
function notifyMe() {
  // Let's check if the browser supports notifications
  if (!("Notification" in window)) {
    alert("This browser does not support desktop notification");
  }

  // Let's check whether notification permissions have already been granted
  else if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
    // If it's okay let's create a notification
    var notification = new Notification("Hi there!");
  }

  // Otherwise, we need to ask the user for permission
  else if (Notification.permission !== 'denied') {
    Notification.requestPermission(function (permission) {
      // If the user accepts, let's create a notification
      if (permission === "granted") {
        var notification = new Notification("Hi there!");
      }
    });
  }

  // At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you 
  // want to be respectful there is no need to bother them any more.
}
