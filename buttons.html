<p>Making your own Chrome sound button is easy. Before you do, you're gonna need a couple of files of your own:
<br>icon.png - a 16x image that'll show on Chrome
<br>image.png - the image when you press the button
<br>soundclip.ogg - the audio that plays when you hit the button.<br>
You may be able to change the extension for some, but not all. for an example, you can change image.png to image.gif, but not icon.png to icon.jpeg. You'll also, obviously, need to change the code in the respective script to reflect this.<br>
once you got all that done, it's merely a matter of changing the text in all the files.
